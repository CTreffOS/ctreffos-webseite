<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
The Chaostreff Osnabr체ck e.V. stores just that much personal data as is
absolutley necessary in order to offer information and services to
visitors and members in reliable and safe way.
</p>

<p>
We ourselves operate the server as a VServer with all services. An
evaluation of the logfiles of the services will be done exclusively by
ourselves und only to detect possible errors or intrusion attempts.
</p>

<p>
We therefore decided explicitely to avoid the usage of cookies and
tracking tools for the analysis of the data traffic like e.g.
GoogleAnalytics.
</p>

<p>
We only pass any parts of the collected data according to legal demands
e.g. to law enforcement authorities or tax authorities.
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, we break down exactly at which opportunity we store
which data for what time period. The subsequently mentioned password
storage does not mean the plain text storage of the password but
the storage of the password hashes instead. We further describe the
steps necessary to delete those data that are not deleted
automatically.
</p>

<h2>Visit of our Website</h2>

used web browser, referer URL and visited page.
</p>

<p>

<h3>Storage and Deletion</h3>

<p>
Automatic deletion of the web server logfiles as soon as they are

<h2>Use of our public video chat</h2>

<p>
The open source software Jitsi Meet is used to transmit video and
audio signals. Based on WebRTC, data and media streams are transmitted
encrypted via Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and Secure
Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). However, WebRTC does not (yet)
offer the possibility of encrypting video chats with several people
end-to-end. This means: On the transport route or in the network the
video chat is encrypted, but on the video chat server the entire data
traffic is decrypted and can therefore be viewed by the provider.
</p>

<p>
As the provider we do not store any information about you or
the video chats. Nothing is logged or saved/recorded. The logging
level is reduced to such an extent that not even the IP addresses of
the users are recorded. Any NAT client can determine its pulic IP
address using an STUN server and can thereby establish a direct
connection between participants. Our Jitsi server uses following STUN
servers:
stun.nextcloud.com:443 und meet-jit-si-turnrelay.jitsi.net:443.
</p>

<p>
If you do not trust us as the provider, you also have the possibility
of hosting your own Jitsi Meet instance.
