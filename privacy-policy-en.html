<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
The Chaostreff Osnabr체ck e.V. stores just that much personal data as is
absolutley necessary in order to offer information and services to
visitors and members in reliable and safe way.

<p>
We ourselves operate the server as a VServer with all services. An
evaluation of the logfiles of the services will be done exclusively by

GoogleAnalytics.

We only pass any parts of the collected data according to legal demands
e.g. to law enforcement authorities or tax authorities.

which data for what time period. The subsequently mentioned password
storage does not mean the plain text storage of the password but
the storage of the password hashes instead. We further describe the
steps necessary to delete those data that are not deleted
automatically.
