<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
The Chaostreff Osnabr체ck e.V. stores just that much personal data as is
absolutley necessary in order to offer information and services to
visitors and members in reliable and safe way.
</p>

<p>
We ourselves operate the server as a VServer with all services. An
evaluation of the logfiles of the services will be done exclusively by
ourselves und only to detect possible errors or intrusion attempts.
</p>

<p>
We therefore decided explicitely to avoid the usage of cookies and
tracking tools for the analysis of the data traffic like e.g.
GoogleAnalytics.
</p>

<p>
We only pass any parts of the collected data according to legal demands
e.g. to law enforcement authorities or tax authorities.
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, we break down exactly at which opportunity we store
which data for what time period. The subsequently mentioned password
storage does not mean the plain text storage of the password but
the storage of the password hashes instead. We further describe the
steps necessary to delete those data that are not deleted
automatically.
</p>

<h2>Visit of our Website</h2>

<h3>Logfiles of the Web Server</h3>

<p>
Source-IP-Address, timestamp, used operating system,
used web browser, referer URL and visited page.
</p>

<h3>Location of our Regular Meeting</h3>

<p>
We link OpenStreetMap to visualisze the location of our regular
meeting.
</p>

<h3>Storage and Deletion</h3>

<p>
Automatic deletion of the web server logfiles as soon as they are
elder than 10 days.
</p>

<h2>Use of our Public Video Chat</h2>

<p>
The open source software Jitsi Meet is used to transmit video and
audio signals. Based on WebRTC, data and media streams are transmitted
encrypted via Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and Secure
Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). However, WebRTC does not (yet)
offer the possibility of encrypting video chats with several people
end-to-end. This means: On the transport route or in the network the
video chat is encrypted, but on the video chat server the entire data
traffic is decrypted and can therefore be viewed by the provider.
</p>

<p>
As the provider we do not store any information about you or the video
chats. Nothing is logged or saved/recorded. The logging level is
reduced to such an extent that not even the IP addresses of the users
are recorded.
</p>

<p>
However, each Jitsi server stores a minimum of data in the local
storage of a web browser. The local storage is a modern form of so the
called cookies. The stored data make the usage of Jitsi more
comfortable and they comprise e.g. the recently visited conferences
and the display name of a user within a conference.
</p>

<p>
Any NAT client can determine its pulic IP address using an STUN server
and can thereby establish a direct connection between participants.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://meet.osna.social" rel="noreferer" target="_blank">meet.osna.social</a>
uses an own STUN server running on the same server. This Jitsi server is
dimensioned for many concurrent users and conferences.
</p>

<p>
If you do not trust us as the provider, you also have the possibility
of hosting your own Jitsi Meet instance.
</p>
